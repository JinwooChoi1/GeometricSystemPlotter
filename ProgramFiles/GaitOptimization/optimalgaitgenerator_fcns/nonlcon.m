function [A,Aeq]=nonlcon(y,s,n,dimension,lb,ub)
%%%%%%%%% 
%
%This function imposes the nonlinear constraint that all the points forming the gait stay within bounds
%
%Inputs:
%
%y: Fourier series coefficients that describe the gait
%s: System file which contains the connection vector field, CCF's and
%   metric data
%n: Number of points used to parametrize the gaits in a direct
%   transcription method
%dimension: Indicates the number of shape variables of the system
%lb: Lower bound of shape variables for each point which is obtained from the grid inside which an optimal gait is desired
%ub: Upper bound of shape variables for each point which is obtained from the grid inside which an optimal gait is desired
% 
%%%%%%%%%

% % The first step is to obtain a direct transciption parametrization of the gait from the 
% % fourier series parametrization
y1 = path_from_fourier(y,n,dimension);
y2=y1(:);

%b=length(y2);

% A1 and A2 together impose the constraint that all the points forming the gait stay in bounds
A1=y2+lb;
A2=-y2-ub;

A = [A1;A2];


% Make sure the frequency doesn't get changed from 2*pi
Aeq = y(end,:) - 2*pi;
